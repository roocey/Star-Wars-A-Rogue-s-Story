# Star Wars A Rogue's Story
A Roguelike from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

Star Wars: A Rogue's Story was written with Python 2.7. The primary library used was libtcod 1.5 (aka the Doryen Library).

By default, Star Wars: A Rogue's Story is only supported on Windows. The main reason for this is because of the usage of ctypes to create the popup window. The source should be fully accessible on any platform that supports Python 2.7.

Star Wars: A Rogue's Story was written by roocey (Andrew Wright).
